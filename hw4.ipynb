    "## Exercise 1: Implementing `DummyClassifier` \n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "rubric={points:25}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course (unlike CPSC 340) you will generally **not** be asked to implement machine learning algorihtms (like logistic regression) from scratch. However, this exercise is an exception: you will implement the simplest possible classifier, `DummyClassifier`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, `DummyClassifier` is meant as a baseline and is generally the worst possible \"model\" you could \"fit\" to a dataset. All it does is predict the most popular class in the training set. So if there are more 0s than 1s it predicts 0 every time, and if there are more 1s than 0s it predicts 1 every time. For `predict_proba` it looks at the frequencies in the training set, so if you have 30% 0's 70% 1's it predicts `[0.3 0.7]` every time. Thus, `fit` only looks at `y` (not `X`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will find starter code for a class called `MyDummyClassifier`, which has methods `fit()`, `predict()`, `predict_proba()` and `score()`. Your task is to fill in those four functions. To get your started, I have given you a `return` statement in each case that returns the correct data type: `fit` can return nothing, `predict` returns an array whose size is the number of examples, `predict_proba` returns an array whose size is the number of examples x 2, and `score` returns a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next code block has some tests you can use to assess whether your code is working. \n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest starting with `fit` and `predict`, and making sure those are working before moving on to `predict_proba`. For `predict_proba`, you should return the frequency of each class in the training data, which is the behaviour of `DummyClassifier(strategy='prior')`. Your `score` function should call your `predict` function. Again, you can compare with `DummyClassifier` using the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify this question, you can assume **binary classification**, and furthermore that these classes are **encoded as 0 and 1**. In other words, you can assume that `y` contains only 0s and 1s. The real `DummyClassifier` works when you have more than two classes, and also works if the target values are encoded differently, for example as \"cat\", \"dog\", \"mouse\", etc."

    "Meta-comment: you might be wondering why we're going into \"implementation\" here if this course is about _applied_ ML. In CPSC 340, we would go all the way down into `LogisticRegression` and understand how `fit` works, line by line. Here we're not going into that at all, but I still think this type of question (and Exercise 1) is a useful middle ground. I do want you to know what is going on in `Pipeline` and in `cross_validate` even if we don't cover the details of `fit`. To get into logistic regression's `fit` requires a bunch of math; here, we're keeping it more conceptual and avoiding all those prerequisites."
